## Variables & Types

**Implicit Casting (automatically)** - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
- char -> int -> long -> float -> double

**Explicit Casting (manually)** - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
- double -> float -> long -> int -> char

```
double myDouble = 9.78;
int myInt = (int) myDouble;    // Manual casting: double to int
```
